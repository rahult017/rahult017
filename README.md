# 👋 Hi, I’m Rahul Thakur

### Senior Python Backend Engineer | Django • Flask • FastAPI | GenAI Prompt Engineer

I’m a backend-focused software engineer with **7+ years of real-world experience** building reliable, scalable, and secure applications. I enjoy turning complex problems into clean, working solutions—and I genuinely care about writing code that lasts.
